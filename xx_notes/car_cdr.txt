The primitive Cons means to construct. Cons takes two arguments and returns a list constructed from the arguments. In this capacity, it provides a means of combination for Scheme.

Car : Contents of Address part of the Register. Car will return the first element in a list. (primitive)

Cdr : Contents of Decrement part of the Register. I.e. the second and subsequent items in a list. (primitive)

Cadr is a nested application of car and cdr. This is the contents of the address part of contents of the decrement part of the register. (primitive)

Primitive definitions:

car  = first item
cdr  = second and all subsequent items in list

cadr = second item
